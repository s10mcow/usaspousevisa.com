This is the initial step to get the ball rolling. 

Be aware, it takes some time to get a response from the USCIS. 

They recorded receiving our application in July 11th and the corresponding actual processing of the form took about 5 months. So as soon as you have the idea that you and your spouse want to move over to the USA. Fill this out and send it in!

This [page](https://www.uscis.gov/i-130) will get you started on the process, but I will include some more links below to the pieces of it. 

So what do you need to submit?

## I-130, Petition for Alien Relative

* [Form I-130](https://www.uscis.gov/system/files_force/files/form/i-130.pdf)
* [Form I-130 Instructions](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-130instr.pdf)

## The I-130 form instructions above outlines the following documents needed below, but this is a helper...

* A copy of USA passport to prove my citizenship
* Marriage certificate (translated or international version)
* 4 USA passport size photos of both (2) myself and (2) my spouse
* Childrens international birth certificate to prove bona fide marriage - this can be done in a number of other ways but for us it was the simplest. 

## Fee $535 USD (2019), we paid this by credit card using this form
  * [Form G-1450](https://www.uscis.gov/g-1450)
  

## Form G-1145, E-notification when USCIS has received your application
