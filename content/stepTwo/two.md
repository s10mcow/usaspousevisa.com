Onto the second step in the what seems like never ending process...

This was quite a long process for us and probably the longest of the entire process.

## Quick timeline (2019)

- **February 16th** - we received our case and invoice numbers which allowed us to log in to the CEAC.
- **February 16th** - Email notification for receipt for payment of the next two fees.
- **March 21st** - Notification of DS-260 received but need to process all the documents in order to proceed.
- **April 1st** - Same notificaion as March 21st
- **May 21st** - replace police report with correct version (DPI was too low in the scanned police report we received from the colsulate)
- **May 21st** - 1040 document is an editable PDF form. Please replace this with a scan that is not editable.
- **June 14th** - Submit proof of my current employment
- **June 14th** - Submit every Form W-2/1099 on my 2018 tax transcript or tax return.
- **June 14th** - Failed to meet min required income level
- **June 14th** - Please submit proof of my assets that were entered on their Affidavit of Support Form
- **July 27th** - Failed to meet min required income level
- **July 27th** - All required documents received and approved
- **August 15th - Immigrant Visa Interview Appointment Received!!!**

In short from basically end of March until end of July we were waiting for police reports, and playing back and forth the the NVC. This timeline might be shorter for other people.

One important point I got out of this was the 1040 tax return. THe tax return was not a photocopy but a live and editable PDF so be sure not to do this. Best is to print and scan it, and then upload the scan.

As you can see I failed to meet min requirements for support and thus needed to submit my assets (more on this later).

I'll drop a bunch of links further down as a quick reference to all this.

[Department of State's Consular Electronic Application Center (CEAC)](https://ceac.state.gov/IV)

To start with you are given the opportunity to pay yet another two fees.

- Affidavit of Support Fee (Petitioner) \$120.00
- Immigrant Visa Fee (Applicant) \$325.00

Once thats taken care of you are then able to continue and fill out two sections based on the application and Petitioner roles.

## Petitioner Forms

[I-864](https://www.uscis.gov/i-864)

For the petitioner its basically pretty simple (in theory), you need to be able to prove that you are able to support your family when moving to the US. Based on family size there is a formula to determine this - [I-864P](https://www.uscis.gov/i-864p) - basically 125% above what is deemed poverty levels for your family size. For us we are a family of 4 so I needed to prove through a tax return that I have earned more than \$32,187. Not a huge amount however this came back huge to bite us later on. So first fill out the [I-864 Affidavit of Support](https://www.uscis.gov/i-864)
form, and then include your latest tax return to prove income higher than the above number.

I ended up playing ping pong back and forth about 3 times for this document which was quite time costly as each time I fixed an issue and reuploaded, we needed to wait an additional 3-4 weeks.

Finally onto the AOS and why we failed to meet requirements for financial support, basically I was working and made enough money but most of it was in my company which was a Portuguese entity and thus not on my tax return for the USA. Im not sure if i were to have included my company's Portuguese tax returns it would have helped me. Anyways we decided to go with the later solution and show assets.

The formual goes as follows from Page 10, Item number 10 of [i-864 Instructions](https://www.uscis.gov/system/files_force/files/form/i-864instr.pdf)

`Total Value of Assets. In order to qualify based on the value of your assets, the total value of your assets must equal at least five times the difference between your total household income and the current Federal Poverty Guidelines for your household size. However, if you are a U.S. citizen and you are sponsoring your spouse or child age 18 years of age or older, the total value of your assets must only be equal to at least three times the difference. If the intending immigrant is a foreign national orphan who will be adopted in the United States after he or she acquires legal permanent residence, and who will, as a result, acquire citizenship under section 320 of the INA, the total value of your assets need only equal the difference.`

So for example say your income was `20,000 USD` and the you have a family of `4` so `125% of poverty level is $32,187`.

```
$32,187 - $20,000 = $12,187
Household size: $12,187 * 5 = $60,935
Assets greater than or equal to $60,935 needed
```

So I needed only to prove three times the difference.

So we ended up getting our house reevaluated since we were going to keep it, which cost us 500 euros for a dual lanaguge evaluation, add it to the ever growing list of costs.

In the end during the interview process which is the next step, the interviewer was not even concerned with looking at our assets and told my wife - "They want to see cash." This was an incredibly frusterating moment as we put some much time and extra money into proving our assets. But more on this in the net step...

## Applicant Forms

The applicant needs to fill out the DS-260 - Online Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration Application. This is a pretty large but pretty straight forward form to fill out as long as you dont have the complicated scenario we had.

We needed to get 4 police reports for my wife as she had lived in 4 different countries since the age of 16. Most were quite easy to obtain, but the UK police report had the most baggage along with it. Never the less about 50 USD give or take per police report.

The form basically has 8 sections:

- Personal
- Address and phone
- Family
- Previous USA travel
- Work/Education/Training
- Petitioner
- Security and background
- SSN

When we came upon the addresses and phone section. Oh dear...

According to the info on the applications:

```
Previous addresses should only include those addresses at which you established
a residence (for example on campus housing where you lived for an academic term
at your college or university) and should not include places at which you were
temporarily present (for example a hotel at which you stayed for vacation).
```

This is what the above police reports section is based upon. But long story short we spent about 10 years living between Portugal and Austria in pretty much different addresses in both countries for each year.

It took us some time to get everything enetered onto the system and the site has it's "issues." I highly recommend saving each and every section you enter as soon as its entered, as the system continously kicks you back to a Capcha section - its very annoying and frusterating to fill out a form with this behavior.

It's much better of course than entereing everything on a paper and snail mailing it in but yeah. We ended up with a quite large list here.

After the form is filled in you are able to submit it for checking, we had no issues so then next we needed to upload the civil documents.
